# Japanese Markdown Parser

I was facing the problem while learning japanese, that I couldn't easily switch keyboards while writing md files.
So i made a parser that would look for matches in a given md file and would convert the text in the match to Hiragana/Katakana.

## Current State

It successfully parses a hardcoded file to Hiragana.

## Todo

[X] Take in filename
br
[ ] Also parse with extra args in the text (Add Katakana support)
